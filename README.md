# TTC Transport Bus Initiative Analysis

## Overview

This repository provides the foundation for analyzing the TTC Transport Bus Initiative, which operated during the winter of 2023-2024 to support homeless individuals in Toronto. The project examines service usage patterns, focusing on the number of clients served, those transported to shelters, and those who remained stationary. This analysis aims to inform future interventions for vulnerable populations during extreme weather conditions. You may customize or remove aspects of this project as needed to suit your specific analysis objectives.
